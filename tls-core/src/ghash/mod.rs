// module ghash implements a method of computing the AES-GCM's GHASH function
// in a secure two-party computation (2PC) setting using 1-of-2 Oblivious
// Transfer (OT). The parties start with their secret shares of H (GHASH key) end at
// the end each gets their share of the GHASH output.
// The method is decribed here:
// (https://tlsnotary.org/how_it_works#section4).

// To demonstrate, let's say that S has his shares H1_s and H2_s and receiver
// has her shares H1_r and H2_r. They need to compute shares of H3.
// H3 = (H1_s + H1_r)*(H2_s + H2_r) = H1_s*H2_s + H1_s*H2_r + H1_r*H2_s +
// H1_r*H2_r. Term 1 can be computed by S locally and term 4 can be
// computed by R locally. Only terms 2 and 3 will be computed using
// GHASH 2PC. R will obliviously request values for bits of H1_r and H2_r.
// The XOR sum of all values which S will send back plus H1_r*H2_r will
// become R's share of H3.

// When performing block multiplication in 2PC, Receiver holds the Y value and
// Sender holds the X value.
// MXTableFull is masked XTable which Sender has at the beginning of OT.
// MXTableFull must not be known to Receiver.
type MXTableFull = Vec<[u128; 2]>;
// MXTable is masked XTable which Receiver will end up having after OT
type MXTable = Vec<u128>;
// YBits are Receiver's bits of Y in big-endian order. Based on these bits
// Sender will send MXTable via OT.
// The convention for the returned Y bits:
// A) powers are in an ascending order: first powers[1], then powers[2] etc.
// B) bits of each power are placed in BE order.
type YBits = Vec<bool>;

#### Latency Sweep Benchmark ####
#
# Measures how network latency affects TLSNotary runtime.
# Keeps bandwidth and payload sizes fixed while varying protocol latency.
#
# Fixed parameters:
#   - Bandwidth: 100 Mbps (typical good connection)
#   - Upload: 1KB (typical request)
#   - Download: 2KB (typical response)
#
# Variable: Protocol latency from 10ms to 200ms
#
# Use this to plot "Latency vs Runtime" and understand latency sensitivity.

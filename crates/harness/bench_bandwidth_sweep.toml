#### Bandwidth Sweep Benchmark ####
#
# Measures how network bandwidth affects TLSNotary runtime.
# Keeps latency and payload sizes fixed while varying upload bandwidth.
#
# Fixed parameters:
#   - Latency: 25ms (typical internet latency)
#   - Upload: 1KB (typical request)
#   - Download: 2KB (typical response)
#
# Variable: Bandwidth from 5 Mbps to 1000 Mbps
#
# Use this to plot "Bandwidth vs Runtime" and understand bandwidth sensitivity.
# Focus on upload bandwidth as TLSNotary is primarily upload-bottlenecked

#### Download Size Sweep Benchmark ####
#
# Measures how download payload size affects TLSNotary runtime.
# Keeps network conditions fixed while varying the response size.
#
# Fixed parameters:
#   - Bandwidth: 100 Mbps (typical good connection)
#   - Latency: 25ms (typical internet latency)
#   - Upload: 1KB (typical request size)
#
# Variable: Download size from 1KB to 100KB
#
# Use this to plot "Download Size vs Runtime" and understand how much data
# TLSNotary can efficiently notarize. Useful for determining optimal
# chunking strategies for large responses.

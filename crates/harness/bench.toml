#### Default Representative Benchmarks ####
#
# This benchmark measures TLSNotary performance on three representative network scenarios.
# Each scenario is run multiple times to produce statistical metrics (median, std dev, etc.)
# rather than plots. Use this for quick performance checks and CI regression testing.
#
# Payload sizes:
#   - upload-size: 1KB (typical HTTP request)
#   - download-size: 2KB (typical HTTP response/API data)
#
# Network scenarios are chosen to represent real-world user conditions where
# TLSNotary is primarily bottlenecked by upload bandwidth.

#### Cable/DSL Home Internet ####
# Most common residential internet connection
# - Asymmetric: high download, limited upload (typical bottleneck)
# - Upload bandwidth: 20 Mbps (realistic cable/DSL upload speed)
# - Latency: 20ms (typical ISP latency)

[[group]]
name = "cable"
bandwidth = 20
protocol_latency = 20
upload-size = 1024
download-size = 2048

[[bench]]
group = "cable"

#### Mobile 5G ####
# Modern mobile connection with good coverage
# - Upload bandwidth: 30 Mbps (typical 5G upload in good conditions)
# - Latency: 30ms (higher than wired due to mobile tower hops)

[[group]]
name = "mobile_5g"
bandwidth = 30
protocol_latency = 30
upload-size = 1024
download-size = 2048

[[bench]]
group = "mobile_5g"

#### Fiber Home Internet ####
# High-end residential connection (best case scenario)
# - Symmetric: equal upload/download bandwidth
# - Upload bandwidth: 100 Mbps (typical fiber upload)
# - Latency: 15ms (lower latency than cable)

[[group]]
name = "fiber"
bandwidth = 100
protocol_latency = 15
upload-size = 1024
download-size = 2048

[[bench]]
group = "fiber"

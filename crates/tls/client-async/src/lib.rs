//! Provides a TLS client which exposes an async socket.
//!
//! This library provides the [bind_client] function which attaches a TLS client
//! to a socket connection and then exposes a [TlsConnection] object, which
//! provides an async socket API for reading and writing cleartext. The TLS
//! client will then automatically encrypt and decrypt traffic and forward that
//! to the provided socket.

## Simple Interactive Verifier: Verifying Data from an API in Rust

This example demonstrates how to use TLSNotary in a simple interactive session between a Prover and a Verifier. It involves the Verifier first verifying the MPC-TLS session and then confirming the correctness of the data.

Note: In this example, the Prover and the Verifier run on the same machine. In real-world scenarios, the Prover and Verifier would be separate entities.

// This example demonstrates how to securely and privately transfer data using Random OT extension.
// Random OT extension allows the sender and receiver to setup the transfer prior to the receiver
// knowing which choices they will want. This is helpful when the receivers choices depend on what
// data they receive via prior choices during the transfer.
// In practical situations data would be communicated over a channel such as TCP.
// For simplicity, this example shows how to use OT components in memory.

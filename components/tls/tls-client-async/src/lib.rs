//! Provides a TLS client which exposes an async socket.
//!
//! This library provides the [bind_client] function which attaches a TLS client to a socket
//! connection and then exposes a [TlsConnection] object, which provides an async socket API for
//! reading and writing cleartext. The TLS client will then automatically encrypt and decrypt
//! traffic and forward that to the provided socket.
